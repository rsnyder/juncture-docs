# GeoJSON

[GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes. It is based on the JSON format. The features include points, line strings, polygons, and multi-part collections of these types.

[GeoJSON.io](https://geojson.io/) is an open-source, simple tool for creating, viewing, and sharing GeoJSON data.

In Juncture, GeoJSON files can be referenced in an essay to overlay geospatial data over maps.
