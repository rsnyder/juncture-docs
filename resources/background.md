# IIIF

The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) is a set of specifications for interoperable functionality in digital image repositories. It is a standard for sharing images (and other media files) across the web, which makes image and media repositories interoperable with each other. IIIF allows for several application programming interfaces (APIs) to describe, interact with, and deliver images on the web. Below are some links that provide more information about what IIIF is and what it can be used for.

In Juncture, the images are displayed using IIIF technology. This allows for rich image delivery, deep zoom, annotation capabilities, and metadata linkage.

# GeoJSON

[GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes. It is based on the JSON format. The features include points, line strings, polygons, and multi-part collections of these types.

[GeoJSON.io](https://geojson.io/) is an open-source, simple tool for creating, viewing, and sharing GeoJSON data.

In Juncture, GeoJSON files can be referenced in an essay to overlay geospatial data over maps.
