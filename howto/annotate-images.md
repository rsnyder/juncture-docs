# Annotating Images

This tutorial will walk through the steps to add, delete, and view annotations in images.

To add an annotation to an image, click the 'Toggle Preview' button in the bottom right of the editor to view your essay and image. In preview mode, click the Edit icon in the bottom left corner of the image.

Once activated, you can add an annotation by holding the SHIFT key and clicking and dragging your mouse to create the bounding box for your annotation. Once the region is selected, add the annotation text in the box that appears. You can also delete any annotations in this Edit mode.

Once the annotations are added, the icon in the bottom left of the image will update with a yellow number indicating that annotated regions are included in the image. In the video below, we are viewing the annotations in the completed essay.
