The `ve-map` tag creates a map viewer that displays a base map with optional map layers.  The map viewer supports zooming and panning.  The base map defaults to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) but can easily be set to a number of [others](/components/basemaps). 

- [Overview](#)
- [Attributes](#attributes)
- [Examples](#examples)

The base map can be augmented with one or more optional map layers. Juncture supports 3 types of layers:

- **Location layer** - A location layer contains all of the individual locations defined for a map.  Locations are defined in a list following the _ve-map_ tag.  Locations may defined with explicit geographic coordinates, a Wikidata entity ID that corresponds to a location, or an IIIF image that contains geographic coordinates in the manifest metadata.  An IIIF manifest created by Juncture will include geographic coordinates if they are found in the [Exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) metadata embedded in the source image.  Locations are displayed as map pins.  If the location is specified using a Wikidata ID and the Wikidata entity associated with the location links to a GeoJSON resource the corresponding shape may be displayed instead of the pin by including the `prefer-geojson` attribute in the list item.  By default, all locations are aggregated into a single layer.  the `layer` attribute may be used to organize locations into separate layers.
- **GeoJSON layer** - [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes. It is based on the JSON format.  A GeoJSON layer is added by including a URL to a GeoJSON file in the list following the _ve-map_ tag.
- **Georeferenced image** - A georeferenced image may also be used as a map layer.  [Georeferencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georeferencing) is a type of coordinate transformation that binds a digital image that represents a geographic space (often a scanned map or aerial photograph) to a spatial reference system, thus locating the digital data in the real world.  One common use of a georeferenced image layer is to create an historic map overlay. Juncture supports the use of georeferenced IIIF images created by [allmaps](https://allmaps.org/).  Adding an allmaps georeferenced image to a Juncture map is accomplished by including the text `allmaps=<ALLMAPS ID>` in a list item following the _ve-map_ tag.

## Attributes

### Core map attributes 

**[basemaps](/components/basemaps)** (_string_):  The name of an optional base map to be used.  A list of supported base maps can be seen [here](/components/basemaps)

**[caption](#basic-map-examples)** (_string_):  A caption to use in the viewer caption bar.

**[center](#basic-map-examples)** (_string_):  Defines the initial center of the rendered map.  This can be defined using latitude and longitude coordinates or with a Wikidata QID.

**[marker](#basic-map-examples)** (_boolean_):  If true a Marker will be added to the map center point.

**[popup-on-hover](#basic-map-examples)** (_boolean_):  Show location popup when hovering over the location (marker pin or GeoJSON shape).  The default behavior is to show the popup when clicking on the location.

**[prefer-geojson](#basic-map-examples)** (_boolean_):  Display a GeoJSON shape rather than a pin marker when available.

**[scroll-wheel-zoom](#basic-map-examples)** (_boolean_):  Enable map zoom behavior when scrolling over a map.  This is disabled be default.

**[zoom](#basic-map-examples)** (_number_):  Defines the initial zoom level of the rendered map.

**[zoom-on-click](#basic-map-examples)** (_boolean_):  Increase zoom level on a location after clicking on a location marker pin or shape. 

### Layer attributes

**[allmaps](#layer-examples)** (_string_):  Allmaps ID of a georeferenced image.

**[coords](#layer-examples)** (_string_):  Location coordinates.

**[description](#layer-examples)** (_string_):  Location description used in a popup.

**[disabled](#layer-examples)** (_boolean_):  Location is not displayed initially.  This attribute must be used in conjunction with the `layer` attribute.

**[geojson](#layer-examples)** (_string_):  URL to a GeoJSON file.

**[iiif](#layer-examples)** (_string_):  IIIF manifest URL containing geographic coordinates.

**[image](#layer-examples)** (_string_):  Location image used in a popup thumbnail.

**[label](#layer-examples)** (_string_):  Location label used in a popup.

**[layer](#layer-examples)** (_string_):  Layer name to associate with the location.  Multiple locations can use the same layer name.  When a layer name is specified the layer may be hidden when the map is initially rendered by including the `disabled` attribute on one of the layer locations.

**[marker-type](#layer-examples)** (_string_):  Type of marker to render.  Recognized values are 'circle'.

**[prefer-geojson](#layer-examples)** (_boolean_):  When using a Wikidata ID to define a location a GeoJSON shape may be used rather than a pin marker when available.

**[qid](#layer-examples)** (_string_):  Wikidata entity ID of a location.

**[zoom](#layer-examples)** (_number_):  Location zoom level when `zoom-on-click` behavior is enabled.

### Geojson styling attributes

**[color](#geojson-examples)** (_string_): Line color

**[weight](#geojson-examples)** (_number_): Line weight

**[opacity](#geojson-examples)** (_number_): Line opacity level (0-1)

**[fillColor](#geojson-examples)** (_string_):  Fill color

**[fillOpacity](#geojson-examples)** (_number_): Opacity level (0-1) of the fill color.

## Layers

Map layers are defined in a Markdown list following the `ve-map` tag.  Items in the layer list may define markers, GeoJSON file URLs or [allmaps](https://allmaps.org/) IDs for georeferenced images. Note that a blank space must be present between the `-` in the Markdown list and the layer item. Please view the examples at the bottom of the page for clarification if needed. 

### Marker layer

A single marker layer is created by aggregating all of the ve-map list items that are not GeoJSON URLs or allmaps references.  A marker can be defined in 3 ways,

- With explicit geographic (latitude and longitude) coordinates.  An optional label may also be specified for the marker.
- With a Wikidata ID that corresponds to an entity associated with a location.
- With an IIIF image that includes geographic coordinates in the manifest metadata

### GeoJSON layer

A GeoJSON layer is defined by including a URL to a GeoJSON file in a ve-map layer list item.  The URL to the GeoJSON file can be defined in 3 ways:
- **An absolute URL** - This would be a URL to any web-accessible GeoJSON file, such as https://data.whosonfirst.org/147/772/818/1/1477728181.geojson
- **A URL relative to the essay** - This is a relative URL path from the referencing essay file.  For example, if the file `my-overlay.geojson` was located in the same Github folder as the essay file the URL would simply be `my-overlay.geojson`.
- **A Github path** - In this notation the relative URL consists of the Github account, repository, and path to the GeoJSON file.  For instance, `/juncture-digital/juncture/examples/geojson/demo-map.geojson`

### Georeferenced Image layer

A Georeferenced image layer is defined by including an allmaps ID in a ve-map layer list item.

    **New York**, often called New York City or NYC, is the most populous city in the United States. With a 2020 population of 8,804,190 distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2), New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States and is more than twice as populous as second-place Los Angeles. New York City lies at the southern tip of New York State and constitutes the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the United States both by population and by urban landmass.

    **Paris** is the capital and most populous city of France, with an estimated population of 2,165,423 residents in 2019 in an area of more than 105 km² (41 sq mi), making it the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2020. Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, and science. For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its very early system of street lighting, in the 19th century it became known as "the City of Light". Like London, prior to the Second World War, it was also sometimes called the capital of the world.

    **London** is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, with a population of just under 9 million. It stands on the River Thames in southeast England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for two millennia. The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains its medieval boundaries.[note 1] The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has for centuries hosted the national government and parliament. Since the 19th century, the name "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which since 1965 has largely comprised Greater London, which is governed by 33 local authorities and the Greater London Authority.
