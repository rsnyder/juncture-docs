# Problem reporting and feature requests

Reporting problems and requesting features can be accomplished in a few ways.

1. The preferred method is to submit an issue using the Github-hosted [issues page for the Juncture code repository](https://github.com/juncture-digital/juncture/issues).
2.  Another option is posting a question/comment to the [Q&A section of the Juncture discussions site](https://github.com/orgs/juncture-digital/discussions/categories/q-a) (also hosted in Github)
3.  Lastly, you can just <ve-contact contact="labs@ithaka.org" title="Contact the Juncture Team" subject="Juncture Contact Form">send us an email.</ve-contact>

Regardless of the method chosen, please include as much detail as possible.  That can really help with the diagnosis.  Screenhots are always appreciated.
